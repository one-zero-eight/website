# 1. Get access to the room <HeaderHashtag link="#1" />

The room is located inside Sports Center, so you firstly need to be listed in access lists.

You should open the bot [@InnoMusicRoomBot](https://t.me/InnoMusicRoomBot), type `/start` command and follow the
instructions.

> ❗ You will be added to the Sports Complex access lists next Monday.

_In case of problems contact the owner of Music room in Telegram — [@poeticlama](https://t.me/poeticlama)._

Be sure to join the [chat of Music club](#chat). There you will find the most up-to-date information about the
Music room.

# 2. Book a time slot <HeaderHashtag link="#2" />

Currently, we use Telegram bot [@InnoMusicRoomBot](https://t.me/InnoMusicRoomBot) to keep track of booked time slots.
Come only in your time slots, so nobody disturbs each other.

> ⛔ Note that the primary booking resource is a bot. Since that the slot booked via other resources (e.g. messages in
> chat or old calendar) are prohibited and would not be treated as official. The booking rules could be changed (all
> updates would be here) due to force majeure situations so stay tuned in the [MusicRoomChat](#chat).

### **Booking via Telegram Bot:**

1. Check section [1. Get access to the room](#1) and make sure that you are registered.
2. Follow the instructions bot provides, find the suitable free time and create a new booking.
3. If you cannot come at reserved time, **be sure to delete** bookings via `/my_bookings` command.
4. Sports Center is opened **from 7:00 till 23:00**, so you can only come during this time.

### Quota for booking

In order to maintain fair use of the room we introduce quotas.

One account can book a limited amount of hours per day and per week. There are multiple levels available (check [6.
Donate for equipment](#6)):

| Status     | Limit per day | Limit per week |
| ---------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| **Free**   | 2h per day    | 4h per week    |
| **Middle** | 3h per day    | 8h per week    |
| **Senior** | 4h per day    | 10h per week   |

### Website

You can view a nice calendar view at [https://innohassle.ru/music-room](/music-room).

If you are registered using University mail, you can see your own bookings
at [https://innohassle.ru/dashboard](/dashboard).

# 4. Rules of the music room <HeaderHashtag link="#4" />

After you have crossed the threshold of the room, you must follow the rules described below. In case of
non-compliance, you would be permanently banned from the music room and all corresponding resources.

- 🚫 Do not remove property from the room.
- 🚫 Do not bring any food and/or drinks into the room. In case you really need to eat or drink, you can do it outside
  the room.
- 🚫 Don't leave trash in the room. There is a trash bin in the room, so you can use it but be sure to take the trash
  bag out if it is full.
- 🚫 Do not fix instruments if they are broken (including broken strings on guitars). It’s better to report this in the
  chat so that the technician can repair them in the future.
- ⚠️ If you don't know how to tune the instrument, don't do it yourself. Find someone who knows and ask him/her to
  teach or help you with it.
- ⚠️ Unnecessarily, do not move the equipment.
