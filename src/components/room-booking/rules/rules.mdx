## Booking Rules

### For Students

Students can book _yellow meeting rooms (3.1, 3.5, ...) anytime_ and _yellow lecture rooms (101, 301, 320, ...) during non-working hours_ (08:00-19:00 on weekdays are restricted), up to 3 hours per booking. You can't book other rooms unless you have special permission (108, 107, etc.).

Club leaders and their deputies can book 309A room, contact 319 if you don't have permission yet.

If your plans change, please cancel your booking so others can use the room. Note that booking can be finished even during its time.

### For Staff

Staff can book anything and anytime, however be sure that the room accepted your request. Booking of lecture rooms during working hours require admin approval. If you need more than 3 hours or recurring events, please book via Outlook.
