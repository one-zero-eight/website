## Development

### Getting started

- Install Node.js 18+, npm
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Set up pre-commit hooks (for formatting and linting): `npm prepare`
- Copy environment variables file: `cp .env.example .env.local`
- Edit variables in `.env.local` if you want to use a different API server
  - Do not change the ID of the trackers so that they are not enabled in development
- Set up your IDE to autoformat code with Prettier and use ESLint

When the API types change, run `npm run orval` to generate new client types and functions.

### Development server

- Start development server: `npm run dev`
- Open in the browser: http://localhost:3000
  - The page will be reloaded when you edit the code

In order to use the API of the production server, you need to change the SameSite parameter of the `token` cookie in the browser (set `None`).
Then the browser will be able to use the correct token to access the API from the local site.

### Production server

- Build the application: `npm run build`
- Run the production-like server: `npm run start`
- Open in the browser: http://localhost:3000

### Production deployment

We use Docker with Docker Compose plugin to run the website on servers.

- Copy the file with environment variables: `cp .env.example .env.local`
- Change environment variables in the `.env.local` file
- Install Docker with Docker Compose
- Build a Docker image: `docker compose build --pull`
  - Note: API server must be running (check URL in `.env.local` file)
    as Next.js will fetch all resources at build time.
- Run the container: `docker compose up --detach`
- Open in the browser: http://localhost:3000

You can set up a Nginx reverse proxy to add SSL certificates for https.
